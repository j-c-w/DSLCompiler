# Overview

This project is a demonstration of a simple DSL compiler.

The project has the following structure:

```
src/   <- this is the source files, most of your editing goes here
_build/   <- this is the build results.
test    <- this is the tests, which go in here
```


Within the `src` folder, we have the following structure:


```
frontend/ <--- This contains the lexer, parser and typechecker
midend/   <--- This contians the middle end of the compiler, that lowers and transforms the code
backend/  <--- This conatins the code generation part of the compiler
compiler.ml <-- This links together the compiler into one executable
options.ml  <-- This contains compiler-wide settings and argument processing
```
